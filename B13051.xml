            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas vpon discouery of some notable abuses in the false dying</hi> of Silke, which had crept in vpon the Trade, by the fraud and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize of some ill disposed persons; whereby besides the iniust increase of the weights, the Silke was weakened and corrupted, and the colour made worse, to the great abuse of Vs and our subiects, and to the apparant ouerthrow of the whole Trade, if the same should not haue beene preuented: Wee taking into Our Princely consideration the many benefits that doe redound to Our louing subiects, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of raw Silke from forraigne parts, and working the same into Manufactures heere at home, whereby multitudes of Our poore people are dayly set on worke and maintained, though to Our owne losse; did heretofore by Our publique Proclamation giuen at Our Court at <hi>Farnham,</hi> the ninth day of August in the sixth yeere of Our reigne, vtterly forbid the vse of all such deceit, and falsitie in the dying of Silkes, and for the present did thereby prescribe some rules to be obserued, for the preuenting of the like abuses thereafter, vntill vpon serious and mature deliberation by the aduice of Our Councell, Wee should bee able to make a more absolute reformation.</p>
            <p>And whereas, Wee finding by experience vpon other Trades, that this so great and good a worke was not throughly and perfectly to bee done and performed by any other way, then by a Corporation to consist of those persons and members thereof, who hauing knowledge in the seuerall Trades or Mysteries of working, and dying of Silke, could best take timely notice of and discouer the seuerall deceipts and abuses, which otherwise would from time to time be attempted, and vsed therein vpon mature consideration, did thereunto encline as vnto the way tending to the increase of the said Trade, and maintaning the estimation thereof (which We much desire,) And thereupon by Our Letters Patents, bearing date at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the twentieth day of May last did constitute, ordaine and declare, that the persons therein named, being persons vsing the Trade of buying, selling and working of Silke, Gold, and Siluer threed, and the seuerall Manufactures thereof, and their successors should for euer hereafter be one bodie politique, and corporate by the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:185593:2"/>name of the Gouernour and Company of Silkmen of <hi>London,</hi> for the well ordering of the Silke Trade, throughout the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> thereby giuing them full power and authoritie, to make, ordeine, and establish all, or any such Lawes, Statutes, Acts, Orders, Constitutions and ordinances, for the good gouernment, order and rule of the said Gouernour and Company, and euery or any of them; As also all and singular other subiects of Vs, Our Heires and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, residing within Our Kingdomes of <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling with, or in any wise vsing or exercising the Art, Trade, or Mysterie of a Silke-man selling, or working of Silke, gold, or siluer threed, or Manufactures made of them, euery, or any of them, as to them should seeme meet and conuenient, for the taking away, punishing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting all present and future abuses, that then had or at any time then after, should or might arise or grow vpon the said Trade, in the throwing, twisting, dying, mixing, weauing, working or selling of Silke, or Silke wares, or Gold, or Siluer threed, or in the seuerall Manufactures made of them, euery or any of them; and also all other abuses whatsoeuer, from time to time growing or arising vpon the said Silke Trade. And the same Statutes, Lawes, Acts, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Constitutions and Ordinances so had and made, to put in vre and execution accordingly, and at their pleasure to reuoke, repeale and dissolue the same, or any of them: which Letters Pattents We were the rather enclined to grant, for that We reposed speciall trust and confidence in those of the said Company, for the well ordering of the said Trade, and taking away the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses vsed therein.</p>
            <p>And whereas at the time of the publishing of the foresaid Proclamation, because it was then conceiued these nine collours, <hi>Viz</hi> Liuer colour, Deroy, Tawnie, Purple, French greene, Gingerline, Deere colour, Orenge colour or light Russet, could not bee dyed without some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of weight more then other colours, and thereupon more allowances of weight and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, were thereby prescribed to those colours, then to all others.</p>
            <p>And forasmuch, as it hath lately appeared vnto Vs, by the humble Petition of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Company of Silke-men aforesaid, that vpon seuerall sollemne debates and tryals, by them made, foure of those colours, <hi>viz.</hi> French greene, Gingerline, Deere colour, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renge colour may be dyed, without any encrease of weight other then all other colours haue, And the rest, <hi>viz.</hi> Light Russet, Liuer colour, Deroy, Tawnie, and Purple, without so much encrease as was thereby allowed, and that a certaine weight as was then set, cannot safely bee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued vpon any of those colours, in regard some Silkes will be boyled downe to twelue Ounces, and others but to twelue Ounces and a halfe, or neere thirteene Ounces, and yet by colour thereof, not onely those colours, but a multitude of others vnder their names, may be dyed vp to thirteene Ounces and a halfe, and thereby neere an Ounce in euery pound vniustly gained; and that thereupon the said Gouernour, and Company according to the power giuen vnto them, by Our said Charter, Haue the second day of August last made an Ordinance, That whatsoeuer Silke should bee found, to bee thereafter heauy dyed, either by not being fully discharged of the Gumme or increased in the weight, by the ingredients in the dying, aboue the true nature of the Silke it selfe, and what the best and lightest Dye must necessarily adde to make the colour good, firme, and beautifull, that all such Silke so dyed aboue the true nature thereof, wheresoeuer the same should bee found, should, and must be burned and destroyed; which they first published
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:185593:3"/>their generall Court, and after sent for the Silke Dyers and their Iourney men, and haue caused the same to bee openly read vnto them; yet in regard of the certaine weights, set by the said former Proclamation vpon dying of the said Colours, many of them feare not to disobey the said ordinance though the same were made by men expert in that trade vpon sundrie trialls first had, and for preuenting of the said abuses and wrong done to our people thereby, without a due obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of which, and all other the good ordinances and orders from time to time to bee made, the reformation which hath beene desired and intended cannot bee effected: And therefore humbly prayed that out of Our tender care of the good prosperitie of our said people in the Trade, &amp; that the said Gouernour and Companie may bee more readily obeyed in all places and in all the waies of the reformation as occasion should from time to time require, We by our Royall Proclamation would be pleased to declare that we haue reposed speciall confidence in the care and industrie of the said Gouernour and Company, and to command obedience and assistance therein and thereunto from all persons whom it may any way concerne, according to the tenor and true meaning of our said Charter.</p>
            <p>Now to the end that none of our louing Subiects may pretend ignorance of Our Royall Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in that behalfe, but that what Wee haue prohibited and commanded by our said Charter or by Our former Proclamation may be fully knowne and published and accordingly obserued and obeyed, Wee doe therefore hereby streightly charge and command that no Silke-dyer doe at any time hereafter vse any corrupt or deceitfull drugs or ingredients in dying of Silkes either into black or colours, wherby the weight of the Silke shall or may be increased in the dying aboue the true nature of the Silke it selfe, and what the best and lightest Die must necessarily adde to make the colour good, firme and beautifull, And that this may be so done and obserued, We doe hereby will and command the said Gouernour and Company of Silkemen of <hi>London</hi> and their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors for the time being, that they from time to time diligently search for, &amp; seize, or cause to be seized, all such Silkes as shall be suspected to be hereafter falsly dyed contrary to the said ordinance and this Our Royall Command, and foorthwith to make triall thereof, and if vpon triall thereof made, the same shall be found to exceed the weights and allowances in the said former Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion specified, or to be falsly died, though they be vnder that weight, then to cause the same to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that not onely the Silke may bee burned and destroyed, but the true owner the better found out and punished.</p>
            <p>We do likewise strictly charge &amp; command all our people whatsoeuer, in any wise vsing any part of the said trade, that they with constant markes, and as neere as they can, differing from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens, doe marke and distinguish whatsoeuer goods or wares they shall sell or worke, and that no man doe vse an others marke, wherby his owne fraudes may be hidden, and the innocent brought into trouble or suspicion: And for that Wee haue beene likewise by them informed that abuse and wrong may growe to our people by the making gold &amp; siluer thred and oes of false and deceitfull mettalls, stuffe and materialls, Wee hereby vtterly forbid the same, and doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the said Gouernour and Company, that they likewise from time to time make diligent search to discouer the same, and cause trialls to be made of all such as they shall suspect, whereby the same may be found out and punished. And to the end that this Our Royall Command here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be not hindered by such who being faulty may oppose themselues against the searches &amp; trialls
<pb facs="tcp:185593:4"/>from time to time, to bee made by the said Gouernour and Company, and against other the Powers and Authorities granted to them, the said Gouernour and Company, by Our said Charter.</p>
            <p>And to the end their Ordinances may bee the better performed, obserued and kept, We doe hereby streightly charge and command all and euery Maiors, Sheriffes, Iustices of the Peace, Bailiffes, Constables, Customers, and all other Officers and Ministers whatsoeuer, to be from time to time in all things, helping, ayding and assisting, to the said Gouernour and Company, their Officers, and Ministers, and as much as in them, or any of them, whom it shall or may concerne lieth, to see Our pleasure heerein to bee kept, obserued, and performed, as they tender Our pleasure, and will answere the contrary at their perils, and vpon such punishments as can or may bee inflicted vpon the offendours, for contempt of Our Royall pleasure in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.</p>
            <p>And We doe hereby streightly charge &amp; command, the said Gouernour and Company, that they according to the trust reposed in them, by Our said Charter, apply themselues with all dilligence, to the finding out of the deceipts and abuses vsed in the said Trade, and of the wayes and meanes of reformation of the same, and that they doe goe on to make all such further wholesome Ordinances, for the preuenting and punishing of the said abuses as shall be meet.</p>
            <p>And lastly, because there may be at this present, diuers quantities of Silke in the hands of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny persons, which was dyed according to the former Proclamation, and before the said Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance made and published as aforesaid, which cannot be knowne vpon their searches, from that which hath been dyed since, whereby (if all should be taken and burned) the iust may suffer with the vniust. We doe therefore hereby streightly charge and command, that all Silke, short skeynes, or other wise heretofore dyed into any of the same nine colours, be vented or transported out of Our Kingdome, or otherwise boyled off; and discharged of the said die, before <hi>Midsomer-day</hi> next; And if after that day any such false, or deceitfull dyed Silke, either already so dyed, or hereafter to be dyed, contrary to the said Ordinance, and this Our Royall command, shall be found in the hand of any person whatsoeuer, besides the punishments aforesaid, the Silke it selfe wheresoeuer the same shall be found shall be burned and vtterly destroyed.</p>
